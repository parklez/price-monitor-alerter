# Price Monitor/Alerter
This app looks up the current price for each product in a list, and in case of discount, a notification is sent to interested users via a Telegram bot.

The process runs hourly via Github Actions, and for any price change, a row is added to `./prices.csv` (and commited) for future comparisons.
